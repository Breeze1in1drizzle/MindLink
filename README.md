# MindLink-Exploring

To inspire the market potential of MindLink, we will not noly update this repository with new codes, but we will also make some files about market research to get konwn of the need of all kinds of consumers.

There are five students of school of software of South China Nromal University(SCNU) in MindLink-Exploring team: Ruixin Lee, Caizhen He, Zhaoxin Cai, Wenxin Huang and Xiaojian Liu.

Hopefully we can finish this project to make emotions cauculating much easier.
