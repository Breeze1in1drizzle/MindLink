# MindLink-Exploring

MindLink is an open source system which combines EEG and expressions of FACE to classify emotions of humanity. This is a project lunched by MindLink developers.

To inspire the market potential of MindLink, we will not noly update this repository with new codes, but we will also make some files about market research to get konwn of the need of all kinds of consumers.

Hopefully we can finish this project to make emotions cauculating much easier.
